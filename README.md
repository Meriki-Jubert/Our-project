Project Title:  Student Management System with Role-based Control 
Introduction: 
This project is a simple, locally-hosted Student management System built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
and node.js, with a backend database. It allows users to register as either Students or Teachers, offering 
tailored access to academic records based on their role. 
Students can view their grades and report inaccuracies, while teachers can manage and update grades 
without modifying student personal information 
In many institutions, Student data is very still managed or overly complex systems that are inaccessible 
to smaller schools. This project is inspired by the need for a Lightweight, role-based academic record 
system, that works offline without the need for external hosting, and maintains privacy and control for 
both students and educators. 
By separating permissions clearly between user types, this project simulates real-world systems while 
remaining beginner-friendly for developers 
Objective: 
• To design and implement a web-based student management system with clearly defined user 
roles 
• To allow students to securely access the review of their academic records  
• To enable teachers to manage student grades without access to sensitive personal data  
• To store all data locally for simplicity and offline access 
• To reinforce secure and ethical data handling in software systems
